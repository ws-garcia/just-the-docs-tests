# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
